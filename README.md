Interactive Quiz Game

Objective: Create an interactive quiz game using JavaScript that tests a user's knowledge
on a specific topic.

Requirements:

1. Define a set of quiz questions with multiple-choice answers and a correct answer for each
question.

2. Display the first question to the user along with multiple-choice options.

3. Allow the user to select an answer by clicking on one of the options.

4. Check if the user's selected answer matches the correct answer for the current question.

5. Display a message to the user indicating whether their answer is correct or incorrect.

6. Keep track of the user's score and update it based on their answers.

7. After each question, display the user's current score.

8. Repeat steps 2 to 7 for all the quiz questions.

9. At the end of the quiz, display the user's final score and a message based on their
performance (e.g., "Great job!" or "You can do better!").

Implementation Guidelines:

Use variables to store the quiz questions, multiple-choice options, correct answers, and the user's
score.

Implement a loop (e.g., `for` loop) to iterate through the questions and display them one by one.

Utilize conditional statements (e.g., `if` statements) to check if the user's answer is correct.

Define functions to handle various aspects of the quiz, such as displaying questions, checking answers,
and updating the score.

Use appropriate data types for storing quiz data (e.g., arrays, objects) and user inputs (e.g., strings,
numbers).
